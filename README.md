Description: Three Python activities with error handling 
# Logic, Loops & Sorting Lab

Three Python activities:

1. **Discount Logic** — Uses conditional statements to determine customer discounts.
2. **Rating Categorization** — Uses loops to group customer ratings into Low, Medium, and High.
3. **Score Sorting** — Implements Bubble Sort and calculates average scores with error handling.

Completed the Python Programming Fundamentals course, covering core concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and data structures. This certificate marks the foundation of my Python journey.
